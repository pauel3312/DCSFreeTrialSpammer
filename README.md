This is a python script, with a selenium and a pyautogui based alternative
the Pyautogui version is considered not reliable enough, and will probably be deleted in future commits.
In order to use the script, you need to add several files after cloning the repo, that I will keep private.
The templates are:

in logins.txt:
```
<index of the next account to use>
<username1>
<username2>
...
```
